# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement web-based authentication for Visual Studio Code Extension (vsce) publishing instead of requiring CLI personal access tokens. This will provide a more user-friendly authentication flow that opens a browser window for OAuth authentication with the Visual Studio Marketplace.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer publishing VS Code extensions, I want to authenticate via a web browser popup instead of managing personal access tokens, so that I can publish extensions more easily and securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `vsce publish` THEN the system SHALL open a web browser window for authentication
2. WHEN I complete authentication in the browser THEN the system SHALL automatically receive the authentication token
3. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the publishing process SHALL continue automatically
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with retry options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication to be persistent across publishing sessions, so that I don't need to re-authenticate every time I publish.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I authenticate successfully THEN the system SHALL store the authentication credentials securely
2. WHEN I run `vsce publish` again THEN the system SHALL use stored credentials if they are still valid
3. WHEN stored credentials expire THEN the system SHALL automatically prompt for re-authentication
4. WHEN I want to clear stored credentials THEN the system SHALL provide a logout command

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear feedback during the authentication process, so that I understand what's happening and can troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication starts THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating the browser will open
2. WHEN waiting for authentication THEN the system SHALL show a progress indicator
3. WHEN authentication completes THEN the system SHALL confirm successful authentication
4. IF the browser fails to open THEN the system SHALL provide alternative authentication methods
