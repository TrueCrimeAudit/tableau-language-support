# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for enhancing the existing Tableau Language Server Protocol (LSP) VS Code extension to provide a comprehensive, production-ready language support system for Tableau calculation expressions (.twbl files). The current implementation provides basic LSP features but requires significant improvements in reliability, performance, user experience, and feature completeness to meet professional development standards.

The enhanced system will transform the current prototype into a robust, enterprise-grade language server that provides intelligent code assistance, comprehensive validation, and seamless integration with Tableau development workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Language Server Core

**User Story:** As a Tableau developer, I want a reliable and performant language server that provides consistent responses and handles edge cases gracefully, so that I can trust the tool for professional development work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the language server receives any LSP request THEN the server SHALL respond within 200ms for documents under 10KB
2. WHEN a document parsing error occurs THEN the server SHALL log the error and continue functioning without crashing
3. WHEN multiple documents are open simultaneously THEN the server SHALL maintain separate document states without cross-contamination
4. WHEN the server encounters an unknown function or field reference THEN the server SHALL provide graceful fallback behavior instead of throwing exceptions
5. WHEN memory usage exceeds 100MB THEN the server SHALL implement cache cleanup to prevent memory leaks
6. WHEN parsing multi-line expressions THEN the system SHALL maintain expression context across line boundaries
7. WHEN encountering incomplete expressions during typing THEN the system SHALL provide partial validation without generating false errors
8. WHEN parsing complex nested expressions THEN the system SHALL correctly identify expression boundaries and avoid misclassification
9. WHEN processing documents with syntax variations THEN the system SHALL handle different formatting styles gracefully
10. WHEN recovering from parsing errors THEN the system SHALL continue processing the remainder of the document

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Tableau Function Support

**User Story:** As a Tableau developer, I want complete and accurate function definitions with proper signatures, documentation, and examples, so that I can write calculations efficiently without constantly referencing external documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I hover over any Tableau function THEN the system SHALL display the complete function signature, parameter types, return type, and usage examples
2. WHEN I type a function name THEN the system SHALL provide intelligent auto-completion with parameter hints
3. WHEN I invoke signature help THEN the system SHALL highlight the current parameter and show parameter descriptions
4. WHEN I use an incorrect number of parameters THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages indicating expected vs actual parameter counts
5. WHEN I reference aggregate functions THEN the system SHALL validate context appropriateness (e.g., no nested aggregations without LOD)

### Requirement 3: Advanced Expression Validation

**User Story:** As a Tableau developer, I want comprehensive validation that catches syntax errors, logical inconsistencies, and performance issues in my calculations, so that I can identify and fix problems before deploying to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I write IF/CASE statements THEN the system SHALL validate proper block structure and flag unclosed blocks
2. WHEN I create nested expressions THEN the system SHALL warn about excessive nesting depth (>3 levels)
3. WHEN I use LOD expressions THEN the system SHALL validate dimension and measure usage according to Tableau rules
4. WHEN I reference fields THEN the system SHALL validate field existence and suggest corrections for typos
5. WHEN I write complex calculations THEN the system SHALL identify potential performance issues and suggest optimizations

### Requirement 4: Intelligent Code Completion

**User Story:** As a Tableau developer, I want context-aware code completion that understands my current expression context and provides relevant suggestions, so that I can write calculations faster with fewer errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type in an IF statement THEN the system SHALL prioritize THEN, ELSEIF, ELSE, and END keywords
2. WHEN I'm inside a function call THEN the system SHALL suggest appropriate field names and constants for the current parameter
3. WHEN I type field references THEN the system SHALL provide fuzzy matching for field names with bracket completion
4. WHEN I use LOD expressions THEN the system SHALL suggest appropriate dimensions and measures based on context
5. WHEN I trigger completion THEN the system SHALL avoid duplicate suggestions and rank results by relevance

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Document Formatting

**User Story:** As a Tableau developer, I want automatic code formatting that makes my calculations readable and follows consistent style guidelines, so that my code is maintainable and follows team standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I format a document THEN the system SHALL apply consistent indentation to nested blocks
2. WHEN I format expressions THEN the system SHALL normalize keyword casing (uppercase for keywords)
3. WHEN I format function calls THEN the system SHALL apply consistent spacing around operators and commas
4. WHEN I format multi-line expressions THEN the system SHALL preserve logical line breaks and improve readability
5. WHEN formatting fails THEN the system SHALL preserve the original content and log the error

### Requirement 6: Robust Error Handling and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a Tableau developer, I want clear, actionable error messages and warnings that help me understand and fix issues in my calculations, so that I can resolve problems quickly without guesswork.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN syntax errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages with suggested fixes
2. WHEN validation runs THEN the system SHALL categorize issues by severity (Error, Warning, Information)
3. WHEN errors are detected THEN the system SHALL provide precise location information with appropriate ranges
4. WHEN multiple errors exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize and display the most critical issues first
5. WHEN the system encounters internal errors THEN it SHALL log detailed information for debugging while maintaining user-friendly messages
6. WHEN multi-line expressions are parsed THEN the system SHALL correctly identify complete expressions and avoid false positive "incomplete" errors
7. WHEN logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) are used THEN the system SHALL recognize them as operators, not unknown functions
8. WHEN expressions contain string literals with special characters THEN the system SHALL parse them correctly without generating spurious function errors
9. WHEN IF/CASE blocks span multiple lines THEN the system SHALL correctly identify all branches and avoid "empty branch" false positives
10. WHEN nested IIF functions are used THEN the system SHALL correctly count arguments across line breaks and avoid parameter count errors
11. WHEN parsing encounters partial expressions during editing THEN the system SHALL provide graceful error recovery without cascading failures
12. WHEN complex nested expressions are processed THEN the system SHALL maintain proper expression boundaries and context
13. WHEN LOD expressions are incomplete THEN the system SHALL provide helpful guidance rather than generic "empty" errors

### Requirement 7: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a Tableau developer working with large calculation files, I want the language server to remain responsive and efficient, so that my development workflow is not interrupted by slow responses or system lag.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents exceed 1000 lines THEN the system SHALL implement incremental parsing to maintain responsiveness
2. WHEN hover requests are made THEN the system SHALL cache results to avoid redundant processing
3. WHEN multiple completion requests occur rapidly THEN the system SHALL debounce requests to prevent resource exhaustion
