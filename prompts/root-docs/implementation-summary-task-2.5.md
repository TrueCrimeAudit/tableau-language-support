# Advanced Error Recovery Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds advanced error recovery capabilities to the Tableau Language Server Protocol (LSP) extension, fulfilling task 2.5 from the enhancement plan. The feature provides graceful error recovery for partial expressions during editing, implements proper expression boundary detection for nested expressions, and adds helpful guidance for incomplete LOD expressions.

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Partial Expression Detection**
   - Identifies expressions that are likely being actively edited
   - Detects common patterns of incomplete expressions (IF without THEN, unbalanced parentheses, etc.)
   - Provides informational diagnostics instead of errors for expressions being typed
   - Offers helpful guidance on how to complete the expression

2. **Nested Expression Boundary Detection**
   - Identifies complex nested expressions that might have boundary issues
   - Detects unbalanced delimiters in complex arguments
   - Provides guidance for clarifying expression boundaries in deeply nested structures
   - Helps prevent common errors in complex expressions

3. **LOD Expression Guidance**
   - Provides specific, helpful guidance for incomplete LOD expressions
   - Detects missing components (aggregation type, colon, aggregation function)
   - Offers clear suggestions on how to complete the expression
   - Reduces confusion with Tableau's complex LOD syntax

4. **Comprehensive Test Suite**
   - Unit tests for partial expression detection
   - Tests for nested expression boundary detection
   - Tests for LOD expression guidance
   - Integration tests to verify error recovery works without generating false errors

## Implementation Details

### Advanced Error Recovery Class

The implementation introduces a new `AdvancedErrorRecovery` class that:
- Processes documents for advanced error recovery
- Handles partial expressions during editing
- Detects complex nested expressions with potential boundary issues
- Provides helpful guidance for incomplete LOD expressions

### Partial Expression Detection

The implementation identifies partial expressions by:
- Checking for unbalanced delimiters (parentheses, brackets, braces)
- Detecting lines that end with operators suggesting continuation
- Identifying keywords that suggest incomplete expressions
- Checking for IF without THEN, CASE without WHEN, etc.

### Nested Expression Boundary Detection

The implementation handles complex nested expressions by:
- Calculating the nesting depth of expressions
- Identifying complex arguments in function calls
- Detecting unbalanced delimiters in nested structures
- Providing guidance for clarifying expression boundaries

### LOD Expression Guidance

The implementation provides specific guidance for LOD expressions by:
- Checking for missing colons in LOD syntax
- Detecting missing aggregation types (FIXED, INCLUDE, EXCLUDE)
- Identifying missing aggregation functions
- Offering clear suggestions on how to complete the expression

### Integration with Diagnostics System

The advanced error recovery is fully integrated with the existing diagnostics system:
- Provides informational diagnostics instead of errors for expressions being edited
- Categorizes issues by type (partial expression, nested expression, incomplete LOD)
- Includes specific, actionable suggestions for resolving issues
- Avoids generating false errors for expressions being actively typed

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: Reduces frustration by providing helpful guidance instead of errors during editing
2. **Better Error Recovery**: Helps users recover from common syntax errors in complex expressions
3. **Clearer Guidance**: Provides specific, actionable suggestions for completing expressions
4. **Reduced False Positives**: Avoids generating errors for expressions that are being actively typed

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements to the advanced error recovery system:
1. Add code actions to automatically fix common issues
2. Implement more sophisticated partial expression detection
3. Add more specific guidance for different types of expressions
4. Enhance boundary detection for even more complex nested structures
