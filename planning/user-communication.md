## üéØ **TARGETED COMMUNICATIONS**

### **For Angry Users**
```markdown
We completely understand your frustration with v1.5.0. A critical error made the extension completely unusable, and that's unacceptable.

Here's what we've done:
‚úÖ Fixed the issue within hours of discovery
‚úÖ Deployed v1.5.1 with full functionality restored
‚úÖ Implemented prevention measures
‚úÖ Committed to higher quality standards

We value your feedback and are working hard to regain your trust.
```

### **For Technical Users**
```markdown
**Technical Details:**
- **Issue**: Import/export mismatch (`ErrorRecovery` vs `AdvancedErrorRecovery`)
- **Root Cause**: Build process didn't catch runtime reference error
- **Fix**: Corrected import statement in `documentModel.ts`
- **Prevention**: Added runtime verification and automated testing

**Code Change:**
```typescript
// Before (broken)
import { ErrorRecovery } from './errorRecovery';

// After (fixed)
import { AdvancedErrorRecovery } from './errorRecovery';
```

Full technical analysis available in our GitHub repository.
```
